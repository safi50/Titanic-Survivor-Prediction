# Titanic Survivor Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

![Titanic Image]([https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/RMS_Titanic_3.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Titanic-Cobh-Harbour-1912.JPG))

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not. The model uses a Random Forest Classifier, a powerful ensemble learning method, to make predictions based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. This project serves as a practical application of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the Random Forest algorithm in a real-world scenario.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The dataset includes various features about the passengers such as:

- PassengerId
- Pclass
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
